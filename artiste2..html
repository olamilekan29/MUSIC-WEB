        <h3>If you ask Brianna Castro about her journey into music, she’ll liken it to a <br> serendipitous string of good fortune. The 27-year-old North Philadelphia <br> native didn’t plan  her path to becoming the singer-songwriter she is <br> today, <br>but everything about the journey felt right as it fell into place.</h3>

          <h3> While she has always loved singing from youth, Brianna was the outlier when <br>it came to musical inclinations within her family. No one else seemed to <br> be into the  things she was: basketball, running track, and music. <br> She slowly honed into  the latter by playing in the school band and singing <br> in the  church choir, which ultimately gave her a nudge towards her <br> performance  destiny. <br> In choir she used to shine during her solos, and would get all the due praise <br> because of it. “I knew I had it a little bit when I was getting the <br> solos and they were like, oh shit, you sound good on this,” she says. <br> The songwriting came at age 15. Brianna was already good <br> at classes like English and creative writing. Once it clicked that she <br> could put words to melodies, she was hooked. Songwriting, <br> she says, is the best way to express exactly what she’s feeling, and how <br> she’s feeling it.</h3>
            
            
        <h3>  From there, Brianna tuned her voice to the sounds of Stevie Wonder and Lauryn <br> Hill religiously—“MTV Unplugged is the reason why I bought an acousti <br>c guitar,” she says—and tapped into the woozy grit of her voice by casually  <br>istening to Tupac, and other rap artists her older brothers would play. <br> The result (in addition to handiwork from Andrew “Pop” Wansel, the key <br> producer who helped her find her way to Interscope) is what <br> listeners today have heard on the backing vocals of Tory Lanez’s <br> “Question Is” and her own “Handsome”: what she considers an R&B, <br> soul and hip-hop fusion. Castro makes music for any space—around the house, at a barbecue—and listeners from Gen X, Y and Z can all <br> appreciate her elastic subject matter. Aside from the occasional <br> number <br> about trifling lovers, her songs run the gamut of real life human <br> experiences: sometimes her own, sometimes not.</h3>
            
            
        <h3>   Now, after putting in work on Philly stages and in the studio, Brianna has a <br> singular goal with her forthcoming music: to be unforgettable. “People go back <br> to their [favorite artist’s] first album for everything,” she says. <br> “I want my first album to be like, Oh shit, she came out the gate with some fire. <br> A REAL classic. Gotta set the bar for myself to do better.”</h3>
